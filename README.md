# Awesome Landing Page

## Overview
This is a simple, responsive landing page designed to showcase a product or service. It features a hero section, a features section, customer testimonials, and a contact form.

## Features
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Hero section with a call-to-action button
- Features section with image, title, and description
- Testimonials section with customer quotes
- Contact form with email validation
- Dark theme with gradient backgrounds
- Hover effects on buttons and cards

## Installation & Setup
1.  Save the `index.html` file to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.  The contact form is interactive and validates the email input.  No query parameters are used.

## Technical Details
- **Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (inline)
- **Architecture Overview:** The landing page is built with a single HTML file and uses inline CSS and JavaScript for styling and functionality.  The layout is structured using semantic HTML elements.

## Code Explanation
- **Email Validation:** The `validateEmail` function uses a regular expression to check if the email format is valid.
- **Form Submission Handling:** The form submission event listener prevents the form from submitting if the email is invalid, and displays an error message. If the email is valid, a placeholder `alert` simulates form submission.  This should be replaced with an AJAX call to handle the form data properly.
